# Genetic representation and operator design
May 28, 2021

This class is an inverted class where students will prepare presentations on
different articles. These articles showcase a variety of genetic
representations and evolutionary operators such as specialized mutation,
crossover, and selection methods. The student presentations will be followed by
a discussion led by Sylvain Cussat-Blanc. Each team should prepare a
presentation of 15 minutes on their assigned article.
