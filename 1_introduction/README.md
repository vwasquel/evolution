# Introduction

In this first class, we'll cover the format of the class and tools to be used.
We'll then discuss evolutionary computation in general and why we're studying
this field. Using Julia and Jupyter, we'll write an example evolutionary
algorithm and genetic algorithm and run them on toy problems.
