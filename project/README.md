# Project - Evolution of agents

The goal of this project is to get some experience running and comparing
evolutionary algorithms. The benchmark I would like you to use is games, but if
you have a specific problem that you would rather work on, feel free to propose
it, however it must be an agent which acts in some way. In this project, you
must either:
+ Compare two existing evolutionary methods
+ Study the parameters of one existing method
+ Test new modifications to an existing method such as a new crossover or
  mutation method
+ Propose and benchmark a new evolutionary method

The method, software, and platform all are up to you. You will be evaluated on
the rigor of the experiments you do, but the ambition of the platform or
challenge you do is up to you. You must work in teams of 3-5 and you must verify
your team and project plan with me before May 4th.

We will work during class hours on the project on May 7th and May 13th. Final
presentations of 20 minutes will take place on the 14th. Please send me your
completed video presentations by the end of the day on the 13th, no extensions
possible.

Here are some open-source evolutionary libraries you can use, but you can also
feel free to write your own implementations:

such as the Atari platform. You are not required to evaluate on all games, just
one.
