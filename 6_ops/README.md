# Genetic representation and operator design
April 30, 2020

This class is an inverted class where students will prepare presentations on
different articles. These articles showcase a variety of genetic
representations and evolutionary operators such as specialized mutation,
crossover, and selection methods. The student presentations will be followed by
a discussion led by Sylvain Cussat-Blanc. Each team should prepare a video
presentation of 20-25 minutes on their assigned article and send a link to the
video to me and Sylvain by noon on Wednesday, April 29th.
