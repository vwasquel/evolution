# Evolutionary Computation

[repository](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/) | [website](https://d9w.github.io/evolution/)

This is a course on evolutionary computation. We focus specifically on the
evolution of agents with a final project on research topics in evolution.
Classes are organized as individual folders with presentations and Jupyter
notebook exercises. To get started, follow the instructions in [the first
class](1_introduction).
