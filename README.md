[repository](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/) | [website](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/)

This is a course on evolutionary computation. The syllabus can be found
[here](syllabus.pdf). Classes are organized as individual folders with
presentations and Jupyter notebook exercises. To get started, follow the
instructions in [the first class](1_introduction).

## Course Outline

1. [Introduction](1_introduction)
  1. [Tools and format of this class](https://d9w.github.io/evolution/1_introduction/1_tools.html/)
  2. [Overview of Evolutionary Computation](https://d9w.github.io/evolution/1_introduction/2_overview.html/)
  3. [Evolutionary Algorithms](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/blob/master/1_introduction/3_EAs.ipynb)
  4. [Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/blob/master/1_introduction/3_GAs.ipynb)
2. [Evolutionary Strategies](2_strategies)
3. [Multi-Objective Evolution](3_moo)

## Project

The evaluation in this class will be based on a project. You will use your
choice of evolutionary methods to optimize an agent for playing games. More
information about the games and implementations will be here soon.
